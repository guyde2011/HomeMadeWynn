# HomeMadeWynn
Wynncraft HomeMade version - WIP
---------------------------------------------------

This is a project of mine which has the objective of mimicing Wynncraft and to be used as a testing enviorment.
This project is mostly coded in Scala, altough I used a source version of the LuaJ library which enables the option of interpatiting Lua Files in Java.
